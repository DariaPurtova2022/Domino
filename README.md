# Domino
The domino game inspired by JetBrains Academy


### What can it do?

- You can play with the computer
- small AI introduced to the computer side (the computer checks how often the numbers could be found on the desk and go with the card with the highest frequency.)
- if the stack is empty and no one can make a move - the draw
- if there are at least 8 cards on the desk and the first number is equal to the last number - the draw
